for this library I've used the following link's model to develop the library
https://www.zpag.net/Electroniques/Arduino/8x8_dot_matrix_1588bs.html

please refer to your own datasheet when figuring out the pinouts.
please do not risk your safety by doing it manually, else remember attach a resistor and not blow yourself up.

NOTE THE PINOUTS OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PINS ARE TO BE LABELLED IN ACCENDING ORDER
(still if you wish to arrange the order yourself is also possible)

This is my 1st library, based around a 8 by 8 LED Matrix.
If an expert views this and can provide improvement or any problems are found, please do not hesitate to cantact me via my email thedappolice69@gmail.com

this library also serves as a tribute to Zenius Tech's teachings, find them on their website : https://www.zeniustech.com/
